# RTCBot

RTCBot's purpose is to provide a set of tutorials and simple modules that help in developing remote-controlled robots in Python, with a focus on the Raspberry Pi.

The tutorials start from a basic connection between a Raspberry Pi and Browser, and encompass
creating a video-streaming robot controlled entirely over a 4G mobile connection,
all the way to a powerful system that offloads complex computation to a desktop PC in real-time.

All communication happens through [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC),
using Python 3's asyncio and the wonderful [aiortc](https://github.com/jlaine/aiortc) library,
meaning that your robot can be controlled with low latency both from the browser and through Python,
even when it is not connected to your local network.
